  <h2>The River</h2>
  <!-- ══════════════════════════════════════════ -->

  <p>
    The Amazon carries more water than any other river on Earth. At the city of Óbidos,
    roughly 800 kilometres from the Atlantic, the river discharges on average about
    176 000 cubic metres of water every second. That is roughly one fifth of all the
    fresh water that all the world's rivers deliver to the oceans — passing through a
    single cross-section.
  </p>

  <p>
    The basin that feeds it is vast: an area larger than western Europe, spanning from
    the Andes to the Atlantic lowlands, crossing the equator, and collecting rain from
    both hemispheres. The mainstem alone stretches nearly 4 000 kilometres upstream
    of Óbidos.
  </p>

  <div class="pull-quote">
    When people say "the Amazon floods," they are talking about a seasonal rise and fall
    that takes months — not the kind of sudden event you see on the evening news.
    The water rises slowly, peaks, and recedes. The question is: does it do this
    once a year, or twice?
  </div>

  <!-- ══════════════════════════════════════════ -->
  <h2>Why Would Anyone Think "Twice"?</h2>
  <!-- ══════════════════════════════════════════ -->

  <p>
    The Amazon basin straddles the equator. Its northern tributaries (like the Rio Negro)
    receive most of their rain during the Northern Hemisphere wet season. Its southern
    tributaries (like the Madeira) are fed by the Southern Hemisphere wet season.
    These two rainy seasons are offset by several months.
  </p>

  <p>
    So it is tempting to think: two rainy seasons, two flood pulses. Rain from the south
    arrives first, rain from the north arrives later — and if the timing works out, you
    might see two distinct peaks in the water level downstream, where everything comes
    together.
  </p>

  <p>
    This idea appears in textbooks, travel guides, and even some scientific summaries.
    It is not absurd. But is it what the data actually show?
  </p>

  <!-- ══════════════════════════════════════════ -->
  <h2>What the Data Show</h2>
  <!-- ══════════════════════════════════════════ -->

  <p>
    At Óbidos — the most important measuring station on the Amazon mainstem, with records
    going back to 1928 — the long-term average hydrograph looks like a single, broad hump.
    Water rises from about November, peaks around May or June, and falls through
    the rest of the year. One rise, one peak, one recession.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is no clean second peak in the average.
  </p>

  <p>
    But — and this is where it gets interesting — the shape of that single hump is not
    perfectly symmetric. In some years, there is a noticeable shoulder: a brief flattening,
    or even a small dip, before the main peak. In other years, the hydrograph is
    smooth and unimodal.
  </p>

  <div class="aside-box">
    <h4>Shoulders, not summits</h4>
    <p>
      The difference matters. A "shoulder" is a wobble in the curve — the water level
      flattens or briefly dips before continuing to rise. A true "second flood" would
      mean the water rises, peaks, falls substantially, and then rises again to a
      second distinct peak. The first is common; the second is rare at major
      downstream gauges.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- ══════════════════════════════════════════ -->
  <h2>The Music Analogy</h2>
  <!-- ══════════════════════════════════════════ -->

  <p>
    To understand why this happens, it helps to think about sound.
  </p>

  <p>
    A pure musical note — say, a tuning fork at 440 Hz — produces a perfectly smooth
    wave. One peak, one trough, repeating. No matter how you amplify it, filter it,
    or echo it through a room, you will never get two peaks per cycle from a single
    pure tone.
  </p>

  <p>
    But real instruments do not produce pure tones. A piano playing middle A produces
    the fundamental at 440 Hz <em>plus</em> overtones: 880 Hz, 1320 Hz, and so on.
    It is the overtones — frequencies that are whole-number multiples of the
    fundamental — that give the piano its distinctive timbre. And those overtones
    can create bumps and shoulders in the waveform that a pure tone never could.
  </p>

  <div class="analogy-pair">
    <div class="analogy-side everyday">
      <h4>Sound</h4>
      <p>Fundamental note (440 Hz) = smooth wave, one peak per cycle.</p>
      <p>Add the first overtone (880 Hz) = the waveform gets a shoulder or bump, depending on how loud the overtone is and when it peaks relative to the fundamental.</p>
      <p>If the overtone is loud enough and timed right, you get two peaks per cycle.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="analogy-side river">
      <h4>Amazon</h4>
      <p>Annual rainfall cycle = the fundamental. One wet season, one dry season, one flood peak per year.</p>
      <p>Add the semiannual component (rain from north and south offset by months) = the hydrograph gets a shoulder or bump.</p>
      <p>If the semiannual signal is strong enough and timed right, you could get two flood peaks per year.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    At Óbidos, the "overtone" — the semiannual component — exists, but it is small.
    Its amplitude is only about 13% of the annual fundamental. That is like an overtone
    you can barely hear: it colours the sound slightly, but it does not create a
    distinct second beat.
  </p>

  <!-- ══════════════════════════════════════════ -->
  <h2>Why It Varies from Year to Year</h2>
  <!-- ══════════════════════════════════════════ -->

  <p>
    Climate is not a metronome. The strength and timing of the rainy seasons shift
    from one year to the next, driven by large-scale patterns like El Niño, La Niña,
    and changes in Atlantic sea surface temperatures.
  </p>

  <p>
    In some years, these climate modes push more rain into the northern tributaries,
    or shift the timing so that the northern and southern pulses are more distinct.
    The shoulder becomes more pronounced. Occasionally, it might look like a genuine
    second peak — but it is not a stable, repeating pattern. The next year, it may
    vanish entirely.
  </p>

  <p>
    Research published in <em>Hydrology and Earth System Sciences</em> has shown that
    flood magnitude and duration in the Amazon basin are significantly affected by the
    type of El Niño event (whether it is centred in the eastern or central Pacific),
    not just by whether El Niño occurs at all. This means the "shape" of each year's
    hydrograph is partly written by the ocean, thousands of kilometres away.
  </p>

  <!-- ══════════════════════════════════════════ -->
  <h2>The Slow Filter</h2>
  <!-- ══════════════════════════════════════════ -->

  <p>
    There is another piece to the puzzle. Rain does not arrive at Óbidos instantly.
    It falls in the Andes, in the central lowlands, in the Guiana Highlands — and then
    it has to travel. Some of it flows quickly through steep mountain streams. Some of
    it seeps through vast floodplains where the river spreads kilometres wide and
    barely moves.
  </p>

  <p>
    This journey acts as a filter. Sharp rainfall pulses get smoothed out. Distinct
    signals from different tributaries get blended. The floodplain itself acts as a
    giant sponge: when the water is rising, it spills out and slows down; when it is
    falling, the stored water drains back and extends the recession.
  </p>

  <p>
    Scientists model this with large-scale hydrodynamic simulations that track water
    across the entire basin — including floodplain storage, backwater effects at
    tributary confluences, and the complicated geometry of the river network. These
    models show that you cannot reproduce what we observe at Óbidos without accounting
    for floodplain processes. Simple "pipe-flow" models get the timing and shape wrong.
  </p>

  <div class="aside-box">
    <h4>A word about "Flut"</h4>
    <p>
      In some languages, the same word covers both river floods and tidal phenomena.
      The Amazon does have a famous tidal bore — the <em>pororoca</em> — where
      the incoming ocean tide pushes a wave upstream. This is a completely different
      process from the seasonal flood. It happens on timescales of hours, not months,
      and it affects only the lower reaches near the coast. Mixing up these two
      meanings of "flood" is a common source of confusion.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- ══════════════════════════════════════════ -->
  <h2>So — Once or Twice?</h2>
  <!-- ══════════════════════════════════════════ -->

  <p>
    The honest answer: <strong>mostly once, with caveats.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    At the major downstream gauges that integrate the whole basin, the climatological
    pattern is a single annual flood pulse. A small semiannual signal exists — it is
    real, it is measurable — but in most years it is too weak to produce a genuine
    second peak. It produces shoulders, not summits.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whether a given year looks unimodal or bimodal depends on how strong the semiannual
    component is relative to the annual one, and on the timing between them. Climate
    variability (especially ENSO) modulates both. And the floodplain system smooths
    and reshapes everything on the way downstream.
  </p>

  <p>
    The idea of "two floods per year" is not wrong in the sense that two distinct
    rainfall inputs exist. But it overstates what arrives at the other end of the
    system. The basin is a filter, and the filter matters.
  </p>

  <!-- ══════════════════════════════════════════ -->
  <h2>What We Do Not Know Yet</h2>
  <!-- ══════════════════════════════════════════ -->

  <p>
    Science is honest about its gaps. Here are the open questions:
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>How often does a true second peak occur?</strong> No one has systematically
    gone through the full Óbidos record, year by year, and counted. That is the single
    most important next step — and it is straightforward, once the data are properly
    assembled. (In the technical dossier, this is called
    <a href="falsification.html#F-1">F-1: the regime occupancy test</a>.)
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Does El Niño push the system across the threshold?</strong> It is plausible
    that certain climate configurations make a second peak more likely. Testing this
    requires combining the year-by-year shape analysis with climate indices.
    (<a href="falsification.html#F-2">F-2</a>.)
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Is the filter changing?</strong> Deforestation, land-use change, and
    alterations to floodplain geometry could change how quickly water moves through
    the basin. If the filter is shifting over decades, the likelihood of a shoulder
    becoming a peak might be changing too.
    (<a href="falsification.html#F-3">F-3</a>.)
  </p>

  <!-- ══════════════════════════════════════════ -->
  <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
  <!-- ══════════════════════════════════════════ -->

  <p>
    This is not just an academic exercise. Millions of people live along the Amazon
    and its tributaries. Their agriculture, transport, fisheries, and daily lives are
    shaped by the flood pulse. Understanding whether the seasonal pattern is shifting —
    whether shoulders are becoming peaks, or whether the timing is drifting — matters
    for planning, infrastructure, and adaptation.
  </p>

  <p>
    It also matters for how we communicate science. Saying "the Amazon floods twice
    a year" is a clean, memorable statement. But if it is not reliably true, it can
    lead to wrong expectations — in policy, in education, and in how communities
    prepare. Getting the nuance right is worth the effort.
  </p>

  <div class="pull-quote">
    The goal of this dossier is not to declare the question settled.
    It is to frame it precisely enough that it <em>can</em> be settled —
    with data, with clear criteria, and with honesty about what we
